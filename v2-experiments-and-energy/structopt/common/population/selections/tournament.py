    Parameters
    ----------
    population : Population
        The population of individuals needed to be trimmed
    fits : list
        List of fitnesses that correspond to the population.
    tournament_size : int
        The number of individuals in each tournament. If 1,
        tournament is the same as random selection. If
        len(population), corresponds to the "best" selection process
    unique_pairs : bool
        If True, all combinations of parents are unique, though parents
        can show up in different pairs. True increases the diversity of 
        the population.
    unique_parents : bool
        If True, all parents can only mate with on other individual.
        True increases the diversity of the population.
