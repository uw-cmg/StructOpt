StructOpt
=========

StructOpt is a Structure Optimization suite designed to identify atomic structures that are energetically stable and consistent with experimental data. Manuscripts published before 2018 referencing StructOpt refer to `v1-clusters-and-defects`. Manuscripts published in or after 2018 refer to `v2-experiments-and-energy`. See the subdirectories for more information.

ReadTheDocs currently only supports documentation in the head of the repository, not in subdirectories, so the `docs` directory contains the documentation for `v2`.
